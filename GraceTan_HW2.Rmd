```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### 2a) Solving a System of Equations  

* 2x + 5y = 33  
* x + 3y = 19

Multiply the second equation by -2

* 2x + 5y = 33  
* -2x - 6y = -38

Eliminate the x-variable through subtraction

-1y = -5  
y = 5

### 2b) Vector Creation

```{r vector}
vector <- seq(1, 100, by=1)
table(vector)
```

Calculate the mean of the 0-100 sequence
```{r mean}
sum(vector)/length(vector)
```

### 2c) Install the dplyr package

```{r data}
library(dbplyr)
first_column <- c("A","D")
second_column <- c("B","E")
third_column <- c("C","F")
fourth_column <- c("D","G")
letters <- data.frame(first_column, second_column, third_column, fourth_column)
print(letters)
```
